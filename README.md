## Description
A real-time 3D ray-trace renderer built from scratch using only the Win32 API.  
The renderer implements the Phong lighting model and supports shadows and reflections, with all rendering performed on the CPU.

## Learning Objectives
1. First steps into real-time graphics programming, including lighting models (Phong lighting), shadows, reflections, ray casting, and basic collision detection.
2. A hands-on introduction to the Win32 API and the Windows message loop, including `VirtualAlloc`, `WindowProc`, `DefWindowProc`, and `PostMessage`.
3. A deeper understanding of low-level memory management concepts such as allocation granularity, memory pages, alignment, and manual memory management.
4. Applying linear algebra to real-time applications, for example using rotation matrices to convert between camera space and world space.
5. Rendering from scratch using a software backbuffer and GDI via `StretchDIBits`.

## Installation
### Pre-Compiled Windowsx64 amd64

[v0.1.0 Release](https://github.com/WhoSayin52/raytrace_renderer/releases/download/v0.1.0/raytrace_renderer.exe)

---

### Build From Source
#### Prerequiste
Before building the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **CMake** (version 3.20 or higher recommended)
- **MSVC Compiler** (Visual Studio 2022 or newer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

> **Tip:** You can use the "Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio" to ensure MSVC is available in your terminal.

#### Steps
Follow these steps to clone and build the project:

1. **Open the Developer Shell on Windows**  
   This ensures all necessary compiler tools are available.
   
3. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ./raytrace_renderer
```
3. Build the project:
```bash
cmake --preset default
cmake --build build --config Release # or Debug if desired
```
4. Build the project:
```bash
cd ./build/Release # or Debug
explorer .
```

## Conclusion
While there is still plenty of room for improvement—such as supporting objects beyond spheres or adding multi-threading—this project successfully achieved its goal of building a strong foundation in graphics programming and understanding the graphics pipeline.

The next steps are to:
- Implement a rasterizer
- Learn DirectX 11
- Progress to DirectX 12
